Polarization information
========================
When ``cone=dist`` and ``radiation=synchrotron_spectrum``, i.e. when taking the full
angular and spectral distribution of synchrotron radiation into account, SOFT will also
store information about the polarization of the detected radiation. Using the ``polimage``
and ``polspectrometer`` sycouts, it is possible to generate output files containing
the polarization information in image or spectrum format. In this section usage and
interpretation of the data will be briefly be discussed.

What information does SOFT store?
